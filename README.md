## What is Online Parking?
The project <i>"Online Parking"</i> is an Android APP that will help to improve vehicle traffic in the city in our day to day. This APP will manage public parking lots in the street of the City of Buenos Aires, supplying information about the availability of them. <br>
Struggling for searching parking slots is a daily problem that can make us feel irritated and we end up wasting a lot of our precious time, that is why we created this revolutionary project to solve these kind of problems that we have to face everyday, so we can help users to not only save time, but also make us feel more comfortable in the process. <br>

## What do we want to achieve with Online Parking? 

<ul>
	<li>Make user feel more comfortable finding parking slots</li>
	<li>Improve our life quality</li>
	<li>Improve city traffic</li>
</ul>

## How does Online Parking work? 

Each parking slot in the streets of the city will have a parking meter with a QR code attached on it, when a user is willing to park in a slot, the only thing the user has to do is to open <i>Online Parking</i> scanner and scan the QR code, once is done, the map will update to all user, so they can see the availability of each parking slots. <br>

<br>
<i>Online Parking</i> needs wifi connection or cellular data connection to work properly since all data is stored in the cloud, we used firebase service to do so. <br>
